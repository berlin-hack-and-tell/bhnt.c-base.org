name: Berlin Hack & Tell
description: >
  Berlin Hack and Tell is a monthly(ish) meetup where eight entities can show their hacks at [c-base space station](https://c-base.org) every(ish) last Tuesday of the month.
  There are 8 dynamically allocated Slots(5min presentation + 5min conversation with the audience)
  Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://hackandtell.org/#code_of_conduct) and show off a silly/hobby project that you can't present elsewhere. Think of it like "stand up hacking".
  Check out the past projects below and sign up on our Meetup page!
