Berlin Hack & Tell (BHNT) has been part of c-base for a long time (since 2011). In the context of the 30year celebrations of this magnificent ancient space-station we will have a special edition of BHNT where the hacks presented have a connection to c-base.

For this special occasion we will pre- allocate the slots - if you have a hack connected to c-base please reach out! Also if you have other ideas on how to make this edition even more special we are all ears!
