After we c_lebrated the first 3 digit BHNT end of last year: End of this January (28.01) we will have the first BHNT of 2025 - edition #101. It is under the shadow of a dark inauguration that might be close to the singularity. Hope some of your hacks can shed some light and illuminate the path forward!

This time we also got the stickers we ordered for BHNT #100 - stickers for everyone - so times are dark - but at least there is thisndic ;-)

To refresh your memories - see some old hacks here:
